       <h2 >Review</h2>
       <p>Pushpa Raj (Allu Arjun) is one of the many coolies in Seshachalam who chop down red sandalwood illegally and sell it by the kilo to powers-that-be. 
        In a syndicate that consists of numerous players, Pushpa slowly learns to find his footing and rise in ranks till the man who would once chop down these
        trees becomes the one giving the orders.It is the fact that his brother (Ajay) won’t let him claim his lineage,something that takes Pushpa from zero to 
        hundred in no time and often becomes the reason for this laid-back, sarcastic, arrogant, even funny man to lose his cool. And right as he gets where he 
        wants to be in life, in comes IPS Bhanwar Singh Shekawat (Fahadh Faasil) threatening to upend the carefully constructed order that Pushpa has put in place.</p>

        <li>Pushpa belongs to Allu Arjun and he is undoubtedly the pillar and major highlight of the film.</li>
        <li> Sunil turns villain for this film and does a decent job.</li> 
        <li>The comedy scenes between Allu Arjun and his assistant work well in the first half.</li>
        <li>Fahadh Faasil makes a late entry in the film and does well in the climax. </li>
        <li>The action scenes and locations are quite realistic and give the film a grand look.</li>
        <li>Ajay Ghosh is very good in his negative role.</li>
    </ul>
    <div><i><b>Drawbacks</b></i></div>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>One of the major drawbacks of Pushpa is the length of the film. </li>
        <li>With three hours long, you get a feeling that scenes are dragged in multiple areas</li>
        <li>the pace of the film is slow in the second half.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>RESULT:</h4>
        <p>On the whole, Pushpa is Allu Arjun’s one man show as the icon star delivers a knockout performance.
             The first half is good but the second half slows down with dull climax.
              As the hype for the film is good, the film will see good collections.</p>
